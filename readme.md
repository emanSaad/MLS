# Deep reinforcement learning algorithms implementation
# The neural networks are implemented in pytroch

 The package contains a Training Manager and is designed such that it reduces the overhead in the  agents classes

# Implemented algorithms 
 1- DQN 
 2- DDQN
 3- Actor-Critic (AC)
 4- Policy Gradient
 5- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
